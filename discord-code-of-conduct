**Our Standards**

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and leaders pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level or type of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all. Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include: 

* Being kind and courteous to others
* Using welcoming and inclusive language 
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences 
* Collaborating with other community members 
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community 
* Showing empathy towards other community members 

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include: 

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances
* The use of inappropriate images, including in a community member's avatar 
* The use of inappropriate language, including in a community member's nickname 
* Any spamming, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior 
* Excessive or unwelcome helping; answering outside the scope of the question asked 
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks 
* Public or private harassment 
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission 
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate 

The goal of the standards and moderation guidelines outlined here is to build and maintain a respectful community. We ask that you donâ€™t just aim to be "technically unimpeachable", but rather try to be your best self.

**Moderation**

Moderators (Tagged as @CS Staff ) have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject messages, comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any community member for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
